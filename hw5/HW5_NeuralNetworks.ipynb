Given an RGB image, this function should return bounding boxes for all of the located handwritten characters in the image, as well as a binary black-and-white version of the image im. Each row of the matrix should contain [y1,x1,y2,x2], the positions of the top-left and bottom-right corners of the box. The black-and-white image should be between 0.0 to 1.0, with the characters in white and the background in black (consistent with the images in nist36).
